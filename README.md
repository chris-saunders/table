## Notes

### Suggestions

I can't think of a better way to structure this component for use with Require.JS + Backbone.JS but I'm sure there must be possible improvements. I'm open to suggestions!

### Licencing

I don't know enough about licencing software to understand where Loader stands. Anyone can use it for personal or commerical use!
